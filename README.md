# Tic-Tac-Toe
The purpose of this project is to practice using the Module and Factory design patterns.

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player goes against the computer. To play, simply click on which mark you want to use then click on a spot on the game board.

To run the project, run it in your IDE.
